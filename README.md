# Friendly Feud

I am currently recreating the SNES version of Family Feud and this is the first stage of completion where the game is playable. 

Features yet to implement:
* the bullseye round
* buzzing in at the beginning of each question to determine which team gets to choose to play or pass
* increment to the different rounds (currently only selects questions indefinitely from the single round)
* obviously the final round
* maybe the opportunity to be returning champs? 
  * this would involve entering a code that gives your family a predetermined amount of money. 
  * it could be formulaic because at the end, ideally, you get a code that corresponds to the amount of money you won so it could be regenerated by the formula

Let me know of any bugs or performance enhancements I can make!
