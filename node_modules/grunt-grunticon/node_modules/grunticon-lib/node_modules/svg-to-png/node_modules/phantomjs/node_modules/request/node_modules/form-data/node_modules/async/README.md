# Async.js

[![Build Status via Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/caolan/async.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caolan/async)


Async is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions
for working with asynchronous JavaScript. Although originally designed for
use with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and installable via `npm install async`,
it can also be used directly in the browser.

Async is also installable via:

- [bower](http://bower.io/): `bower install async`
- [component](https://github.com/component/component): `component install
  caolan/async`
- [jam](http://jamjs.org/): `jam install async`
- [spm](http://spmjs.io/): `spm install async`

Async provides around 20 functions that include the usual 'functional'
suspects (`map`, `reduce`, `filter`, `each`…) as well as some common patterns
for asynchronous control flow (`parallel`, `series`, `waterfall`…). All these
functions assume you follow the Node.js convention of providing a single
callback as the last argument of your `async` function.


## Quick Examples

```javascript
async.map(['file1','file2','file3'], fs.stat, function(err, results){
    // results is now an array of stats for each file
});

async.filter(['file1','file2','file3'], fs.exists, function(results){
    // results now equals an array of the existing files
});

async.parallel([
    function(){ ... },
    function(){ ... }
], callback);

async.series([
    function(){ ... },
    function(){ ... }
]);
```

There are many more functions available so take a look at the docs below for a
full list. This module aims to be comprehensive, so if you feel anything is
missing please create a GitHub issue for it.

## Common Pitfalls

### Binding a context to an iterator

This section is really about `bind`, not about `async`. If you are wondering how to
make `async` execute your iterators in a given context, or are confused as to why
a method of another library isn't working as an iterator, study this example:

```js
// Here is a simple object with an (unnecessarily roundabout) squaring method
var AsyncSquaringLibrary = {
  squareExponent: 2,
  square: function(number, callback){ 
    var result = Math.pow(number, this.squareExponent);
    setTimeout(function(){
      callback(null, result);
    }, 200);
  }
};

async.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square, function(err, result){
  // result is [NaN, NaN, NaN]
  // This fails because the `this.squareExponent` expression in the square
  // function is not evaluated in the context of AsyncSquaringLibrary, and is
  // therefore undefined.
});

async.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square.bind(AsyncSquaringLibrary), function(err, result){
  // result is [1, 4, 9]
  // With the help of bind we can attach a context to the iterator before
  // passing it to async. Now the square function will be executed in its 
  // 'home' AsyncSquaringLibrary context and the value of `this.squareExponent`
  // will be as expected.
});
```

## Download

The source is available for download from
[GitHub](http://github.com/caolan/async).
Alternatively, you can install using Node Package Manager (`npm`):

    npm install async

## In the Browser

So far it's been tested in IE6, IE7, IE8, FF3.6 and Chrome 5. 

Usage:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="async.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">

    async.map(data, asyncProcess, function(err, results){
        alert(results);
    });

</script>
```

## Collections

<a name="forEach" />
<a name="each" />
### each(arr, iterator, callback)

Applies the function `iterator` to each item in `arr`, in parallel.
The `iterator` is called with an item from the list, and a callback for when it
has finished. If the `iterator` passes an error to its `callback`, the main
`callback` (for the `each` function) is immediately called with the error.

Note, that since this function applies `iterator` to each item in parallel,
there is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order.

__Arguments__

* `arr` - An array to iterate over.
* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.
  The iterator is passed a `callback(err)` which must be called once it has 
  completed. If no error has occurred, the `callback` should be run without 
  arguments or with an explicit `null` argument.
* `callback(err)` - A callback which is called when all `iterator` functions
  have finished, or an error occurs.

__Examples__


```js
// assuming openFiles is an array of file names and saveFile is a function
// to save the modified contents of that file:

async.each(openFiles, saveFile, function(err){
    // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error
});
```

```js
// assuming openFiles is an array of file names 

async.each(openFiles, function(file, callback) {
  
  // Perform operation on file here.
  console.log('Processing file ' + file);
  
  if( file.length > 32 ) {
    console.log('This file name is too long');
    callback('File name too long');
  } else {
    // Do work to process file here
    console.log('File processed');
    callback();
  }
}, function(err){
    // if any of the file processing produced an error, err would equal that error
    if( err ) {
      // One of the iterations produced an error.
      // All processing will now stop.
      console.log('A file failed to process');
    } else {
      console.log('All files have been processed successfully');
    }
});
```

<a name="forEachSeries" />
<a name="eachSeries" />
### eachSeries(arr, iterator, callback)

The same as [`each`](#each), only `iterator` is applied to each item in `arr` in
series. The next `iterator` is only called once the current one has completed. 
This means the `iterator` functions will complete in order.


---------------------------------------

<a name="forEachLimit" />
<a name="eachLimit" />
### eachLimit(arr, limit, iterator, callback)

The same as [`each`](#each), only no more than `limit` `iterator`s will be simultaneously 
running at any time.

Note that the items in `arr` are not processed in batches, so there is no guarantee that 
the first `limit` `iterator` functions will complete before any others are started.

__Arguments__

* `arr` - An array to iterate over.
* `limit` - The maximum number of `iterator`s to run at any time.
* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.
  The iterator is passed a `callback(err)` which must be called once it has 
  completed. If no error has occurred, the callback should be run without 
  arguments or with an explicit `null` argument.
* `callback(err)` - A callback which is called when all `iterator` functions
  have finished, or an error occurs.

__Example__

```js
// Assume documents is an array of JSON objects and requestApi is a
// function that interacts with a rate-limited REST api.

async.eachLimit(documents, 20, requestApi, function(err){
    // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error
});
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="map" />
### map(arr, iterator, callback)

Produces a new array of values by mapping each value in `arr` through
the `iterator` function. The `iterator` is called with an item from `arr` and a
callback for when it has finished processing. Each of these callback takes 2 arguments: 
an `error`, and the transformed item from `arr`. If `iterator` passes an error to his 
callback, the main `callback` (for the `map` function) is immediately called with the error.

Note, that since this function applies the `iterator` to each item in parallel,
there is no guarantee that the `iterator` functions will complete in order. 
However, the results array will be in the same order as the original `arr`.

__Arguments__

* `arr` - An array to iterate over.
* `i
