# Stream

    Stability: 2 - Stable

A stream is an abstract interface implemented by various objects in
Node.js.  For example a [request to an HTTP
server](https://iojs.org/dist/v5.0.0/doc/api/http.html#http_http_incomingmessage) is a stream, as is
[stdout][]. Streams are readable, writable, or both. All streams are
instances of [EventEmitter][]

You can load the Stream base classes by doing `require('stream')`.
There are base classes provided for [Readable][] streams, [Writable][]
streams, [Duplex][] streams, and [Transform][] streams.

This document is split up into 3 sections.  The first explains the
parts of the API that you need to be aware of to use streams in your
programs.  If you never implement a streaming API yourself, you can
stop there.

The second section explains the parts of the API that you need to use
if you implement your own custom streams yourself.  The API is
designed to make this easy for you to do.

The third section goes into more depth about how streams work,
including some of the internal mechanisms and functions that you
should probably not modify unless you definitely know what you are
doing.


## API for Stream Consumers

<!--type=misc-->

Streams can be either [Readable][], [Writable][], or both ([Duplex][]).

All streams are EventEmitters, but they also have other custom methods
and properties depending on whether they are Readable, Writable, or
Duplex.

If a stream is both Readable and Writable, then it implements all of
the methods and events below.  So, a [Duplex][] or [Transform][] stream is
fully described by this API, though their implementation may be
somewhat different.

It is not necessary to implement Stream interfaces in order to consume
streams in your programs.  If you **are** implementing streaming
interfaces in your own program, please also refer to
[API for Stream Implementors][] below.

Almost all Node.js programs, no matter how simple, use Streams in some
way. Here is an example of using Streams in an Node.js program:

```javascript
var http = require('http');

var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  // req is an http.IncomingMessage, which is a Readable Stream
  // res is an http.ServerResponse, which is a Writable Stream

  var body = '';
  // we want to get the data as utf8 strings
  // If you don't set an encoding, then you'll get Buffer objects
  req.setEncoding('utf8');

  // Readable streams emit 'data' events once a listener is added
  req.on('data', function (chunk) {
    body += chunk;
  });

  // the end event tells you that you have entire body
  req.on('end', function () {
    try {
      var data = JSON.parse(body);
    } catch (er) {
      // uh oh!  bad json!
      res.statusCode = 400;
      return res.end('error: ' + er.message);
    }

    // write back something interesting to the user:
    res.write(typeof data);
    res.end();
  });
});

server.listen(1337);

// $ curl localhost:1337 -d '{}'
// object
// $ curl localhost:1337 -d '"foo"'
// string
// $ curl localhost:1337 -d 'not json'
// error: Unexpected token o
```

### Class: stream.Readable

<!--type=class-->

The Readable stream interface is the abstraction for a *source* of
data that you are reading from.  In other words, data comes *out* of a
Readable stream.

A Readable stream will not start emitting data until you indicate that
you are ready to receive it.

Readable streams have two "modes": a **flowing mode** and a **paused
mode**.  When in flowing mode, data is read from the underlying system
and provided to your program as fast as possible.  In paused mode, you
must explicitly call `stream.read()` to get chunks of data out.
Streams start out in paused mode.

**Note**: If no data event handlers are attached, and there are no
[`pipe()`][] destinations, and the stream is switched into flowing
mode, then data will be lost.

You can switch to flowing mode by doing any of the following:

* Adding a [`'data'` event][] handler to listen for data.
* Calling the [`resume()`][] method to explicitly open the flow.
* Calling the [`pipe()`][] method to send the data to a [Writable][].

You can switch back to paused mode by doing either of the following:

* If there are no pipe destinations, by calling the [`pause()`][]
  method.
* If there are pipe destinations, by removing any [`'data'` event][]
  handlers, and removing all pipe destinations by calling the
  [`unpipe()`][] method.

Note that, for backwards compatibility reasons, removing `'data'`
event handlers will **not** automatically pause the stream.  Also, if
there are piped destinations, then calling `pause()` will not
guarantee t
